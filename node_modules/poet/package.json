  "readme": "Poet\n======\n\nPoet has your code-blogging back. Renders markdown, jade, or any templated files as posts, tag it up with metadata that's passed into any view engine you want, instant pagination, tag and category views, and home in time for dinner.\n\nView the source for [jsantell.com](https://github.com/jsantell/jsantell.com) to see an example of Poet in use. Much `<3` to [Brittany Fedor](http://bfedor.com/) for the sweet art!\n\n![The Node Poet](https://raw.github.com/jsantell/poet/gh-pages/img/poet.png)\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull documentation for *Poet* can be found at [http://jsantell.github.com/poet](http://jsantell.github.com/poet)\n\n## Poet In Action\n\nThese sites are using Poet for their blogging, check them out! Ping me, or send a PR if you too are using Poet in the wild.\n\n* [Yellow Pages Engineering](http://engineering.yp.com/)\n* [BryanPaluch.com](http://bryanpaluch.com)\n\n## Installing\n\n* `npm install poet`\n\n## Setup\n\nInclude Poet in your package.json and add it to your app, passing in your Express app and options.\n```javascript\nvar\n  express = require('express'),\n  app     = express(),\n  poet    = require('poet')( app );\n\npoet.set({\n  posts: './_posts/',\n  postsPerPage: 5,\n  metaFormat: 'json'\n})\n  .createPostRoute()\n  .createPageRoute()\n  .createTagRoute()\n  .createCategoryRoute()\n  .init();\n```\n\n### Options\n\n* `posts` path to directory of your files of posts (default: `./\\_posts/`)\n* `metaFormat` format of your front matter on every blog post.
