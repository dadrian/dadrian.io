* Almost nothing is truly required for nearly everything
* Don't do something now if you're able to put it off and do it better later
* Many things are only controversial if you act like they're controversial
* The best prioritization is strong and shared conviction in a direction
* It is always good to remove requirements that are bad
* Figuring out how to run the thing is building the thing
