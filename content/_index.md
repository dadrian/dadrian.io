I am currently a product manager at Google, working on adding value to [Chrome
Security][chromesecurity]. Despite this, I identify both as an engineer and
security researcher. I cofounded [Censys][censys], an attack-surface management
security startup. I left Censys after their [Series A][censys-raise]. They've
since raised a ~~[Series B][censys-raise-b]~~ [Series C][censys-raise-c]! I was
employee #2 at [Nametag][nt].  Iâ€™m also a core contributor to the [ZMap][zmap]
open-source project.

I have a PhD from the University of Michigan. I defended in 2018. My advisor was [J.
Alex Halderman][jhalderm]. My research focus was using Internet-wide
scanning to measure how cryptography is used on the Internet. It led to the
discovery of the [Logjam][logjam] and [DROWN][drown] attacks on TLS, and the
creation of [Censys][censys].

In 2021, I accidentally started the ["Security. Cryptography. Whatever."][scw]
podcast with [Deirdre Connolly][deirdre] and [Thomas Ptacek][tqbf].
