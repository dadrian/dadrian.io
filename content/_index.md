I am an engineer and security researcher. I cofounded [Censys][censys], an
attack-surface management security startup. I left Censys after their [Series
A][censys-raise]. I’m currently building something new as employee #2 at a
stealth-ish startup. I’m also a core contributor to the [ZMap][zmap]
open-source project. I do part-time consulting and advising for startups. I can
help with building out early engineering teams and cryptography engineering.

I defended my PhD at the University of Michigan in 2018. My advisor was [J.
Alex Halderman][jhalderm]. I used Internet-wide scanning to study uses of
cryptography on the Internet. This work led to the discovery of the
[Logjam][logjam] and [DROWN][drown] attacks on TLS, and the creation of
[Censys][censys]. I lectured the undergraduate security course in Fall 2016.

I was also lucky to intern with the [Google Chrome security
team][chromesecurity] in 2016, where I attempted to [make OCSP suck
less][expect-staple].

In 2021, I accidentally started a [podcast][scw] with [Deirdre
Connolly][deirdre] and [Thomas Ptacek][tqbf].
