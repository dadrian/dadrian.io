I am an engineer and security researcher. I cofounded [Censys][censys], an
attack-surface management security startup. I left Censys after their [Series
A][censys-raise], and I’m currently looking for what comes next. I’m also a
core contributor to the [ZMap][zmap] open-source project.

I defended my PhD at the University of Michigan in 2018. My advisor was [J.
Alex Halderman][jhalderm]. I used Internet-wide scanning to study uses of
cryptography on the Internet. This work led to the discovery of the
[Logjam][logjam] and [DROWN][drown] attacks on TLS, and the creation of
[Censys][censys].

I completed both my undergraduate and graduate studies at the University of
Michigan. I was also a lecturer and teaching assistant. I taught computer
security and introductory programming courses. While in school, I was lucky
to intern with some outstanding teams. I interned with the [Google Chrome
security team][chromesecurity] in 2016, where I attempted to [make OCSP suck
less][expect-staple].
