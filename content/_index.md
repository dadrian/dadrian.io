I am a developer and security researcher. I am a cofounder of
[Censys][censys], where I currently lead data engineering. I am
[hiring][censys-careers].

I defended my PhD at the University of Michigan in 2018. My advisor was [J.
Alex Halderman][jhalderm]. During my PhD, my research on using Internet-wide
scanning to study how cryptography was deployed on the Internet led to the
discovery of the [Logjam][logjam] and [DROWN][drown] attacks on TLS, and the
creation of [Censys][censys].

Between my time in undergrad and graduate school, I spent nine years at the
University of Michigan. I've been a teaching assistant for most of the
security and introductory computer science courses at Michigan, and I was
lucky to be able to lecture for the undergraduate computer security course in
Fall 2016. I was also fortunate enough to occasionally sneak out and intern
with some outstanding teams, including the [Google Chrome
security team][chromesecurity] in 2016, where I attempted to make [OCSP suck
less][expect-staple].
