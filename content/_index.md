I am an engineer and security researcher. I cofounded [Censys][censys], an
attack-surface management security startup. I left Censys after their [Series
A][censys-raise], and I’m currently looking for what comes next. I’m also a
core contributor to the [ZMap][zmap] open-source project.

I defended my PhD at the University of Michigan in 2018. My advisor was [J.
Alex Halderman][jhalderm]. I used Internet-wide scanning to study uses of
cryptography on the Internet. This work led to the discovery of the
[Logjam][logjam] and [DROWN][drown] attacks on TLS, and the creation of
[Censys][censys].

Throughout my nine years at Michigan as an undergrad and graduate student, I
taught computer security as both a lecturer and a teaching assistant. I was
also lucky to intern with the [Google Chrome security team][chromesecurity]
in 2016, where I attempted to [make OCSP suck less][expect-staple].
