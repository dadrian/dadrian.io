  Nametag mediates PII between users and companies via a push notification approval flow (Stripe crossed with Duo for PII).
  I was recruited to join by [Ross Kinder](https://crewjam.com) after I left
  Censys. I was the second employee and first non-executive hire, and focused on
  backend system design and security architecture.

  I cofounded Censys, a security company in the threat-hunting / attack-surface
  management / Internet intelligence space. Censys began as a research project
  during my PhD, and myself and my cofounders spun it out of the University of
  Michigan. I built the initial product(s), grew the company to $3MM in revenue
  and around 50 employees, and then left during the Series A.

  Due to a shortage in faculty, one of my grad school semesters I had to be one
  of the lecturers for the undergrad security course. It was a fun opportunity
  to get paid double the usual grad student rate. I cotaught with Professor
  Halderman and Professor Honeyman. I introduced course material on padding
  oracles because we had extra time in the cryptography lectures. This course
  material is now canon at Michigan.

  This is the graduate student course on computer security, where everyone reads
  and discusses papers. Being a TA was basically automated by the paper review
  submission system. I continued the tradition of guest-lecturing on
  cryptography for the first class of the semester, because Professor Halderman
  was inevitably still traveling.

  I was an undergrad teaching assistant for the introductory course on
  algorithms, taught in C++. Covered runtime complexity, sorts, trees, heaps,
  and basic search and graph algorithms. This is how I came to terms with the
  fact I am not an algorithms person.
