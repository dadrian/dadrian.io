Conventional wisdom in venture capital is that you have to be contrarian to be
successful. It's so prevalent that venture capital (VC) funds are [named after
it][contrarian-fund]. The thought-pattern is roughly:

1. To generate outsized returns, you must beat the market.
2. To beat the market, you have to go against the market, because if you were
   with the market, you'd just have market returns.
3. Therefore, you must be contrarian to be a good venture capitalist.

The implicit step is to make the right bets. As Reid Hoffman says, it's about
being contrarian and _right_.

But what does it take to be right? And what does being contrarian even mean? Was
it contrarian for Garry Tan to invest in Coinbase in 2012? Was it contrarian for
Jason Calacanis to invest in Uber in 2010? Or for Keith Rabois to invest in
Stripe and DoorDash?

If being contrarian makes for a good venture capitalist, then being contrarian
must also make for a good founder, since good founders start successful
companies that are invested in by successful VCs. Do you have to be contrarian
to be a good founder?

To be a good founder, you need:

1. A set of personality and leadership traits
2. To identify a problem people have and are willing to pay to solve
3. Build a solution to the problem that's better than the alternatives

You don't need to be contrarian to be a transformational leader. To identify a
problem and a new solution, you don't need to be contrarian either---you need to
be able to identify problems, trends, and opportunities. You won't be successful
founding a startup that operates exactly the way existing companies operates and
sells the same product. But finding a new way to do things, a smarter way
doesn't mean that you have to be _against_ existing solutions. Whether you're
building a new product or defining a whole new market, the defining
characteristic of a solution built by startup is that it's _new_, not that it's
contrarian.

Market disruption isn't even contrarian. ARM and TSMC are [actively taking
over][ben-evans-arm] the PC market from Intel by way of cell phone processors.
There's a playbook for disruption: offer a "worse" product but for a much lower
price, and iterate your way from the bottom of the market to the top of a the
market, and that's exactly what ARM processors did. This wasn't difficult to
[see][apple-arm-1] [coming][apple-arm-2].

Here's a contrarian definition of what it means to be contrarian from [Hari
Kondabolu][hari].

> Playing devil's advocate is just a phrase you can say in order to be an asshole under the guise of being objective.

Being a good founder and a good investor is about understanding what will be obvious in the future, but is only just happening now. It doesn't need to be "contrarian".

Being contrarian is an excuse to be an asshole and feel smart.



Few understand this.
