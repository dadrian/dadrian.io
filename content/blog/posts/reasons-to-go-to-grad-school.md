Last December, I {{< staticlink "srv/papers/david-adrian-dissertation.pdf"
>}}defended{{< /staticlink >}} my PhD at the University of Michigan. At the
time, I'd been in grad school for four and a half years, and I'd been working
with my research group for another year before that. I also went to
Michigan for undergrad, so I've been living in Ann Arbor for nearly nine
years. Why did I do this?

Before I go on, I want to say a few things up front. I went to graduate
school in computer science. I can't speak from personal experience about
other fields, and certainly can't speak for non-STEM fields. This post is my
opinion, not some official set of rules. Everything I say about PhD programs
is assuming that the students are all fully funded, either by teaching,
fellowships, or their advisor[^4]. I'm also a white guy from a privileged
upper-middle class background, and so everything I say is colored from that
perspective.

Prior to my senior year of undergrad, I cold-emailed [Zakir Durumeric][zakir]
about the possibility of doing research. Zakir was a second-year
graduate student working with [Professor Alex Halderman][jhalderm]. I'd met Zakir
before, and he was a teaching assistant for the computer security course I
took the semester prior. I almost didn't send the email because I was
convinced I wasn't smart enough to work with Halderman's research group.
Luckily, a friend of mine told me to stop doubting myself and send the email.
This was arguably single most important piece of advice I received in all of
undergrad. I would not have PhD or a [company][censys] today if I had not sent that
email.

Why did I want to go to grad school? It was a combination of reasons, some
good and some bad. I knew I didn't want to spend a career building CRUD apps,
and while you certainly don't need a PhD to work on something else, I was
going to barely be 21 years old when I graduated undergrad. I didn't want to
be an adult, I didn't have any idea what life was like outside of school, and I
thought the [Mining Your Ps and Qs][psqs] paper was awesome. At the time, I
also didn't want to move to the west coast.

The best reason to get a PhD is because you want a career in research as a
tenure-track faculty member. There is no way to have a tenure-track faculty
position without a PhD. Some people will tell you that the market for faculty
positions is a random dice roll, since there are so few positions relative to
candidates. This is not true in computer science, especially in
security and cryptography. Every year, there are a set of top faculty
candidates on the market. Many schools will be interested in the same or
overlapping subsets of candidates. If you're keeping up with the field and
familiar with the hiring process, it's not hard to predict who will be
offered tenure-track assistant professor positions. If the market was random,
you would not be able to identify every year who on the market was going to
get job offers[^5]. The random part of the market is figuring out _where_
that job will be (especially among the top fifteen or so schools), and which
school will actually end up sending an offer to which candidate. Even if
you're at the top of the market, don't expect to be able to get a faculty
position in a city that you actually want to live in. The market is
incredibly competitive.

Imagine there are 100 candidates on the faculty market for computer security.
Of these, only five candidates are qualified. Any given school will think
that only three of the candidates out of the five are a match, then only
manage to send an offer to one or two of them. It is straightforward to
identify who is at the top of the market. It is hard to actually _be_ at the
top of the market. As a grad student, you're have to be one top students in
your field to have a chance at a faculty position. This is hard, but
achievable. Many PhD students are flailing around, because they either don't
actually want to be in a PhD program, aren't getting the support they want
from their advisor, or don't really know what their goals are. If you can
sort out what you want early on, and figure out how to get support
(especially from faculty who are _not_ your advisor), you have a massive
advantage over other students[^1]. If you know you want to be faculty, but
are thinking of not getting a PhD because it's impossible to get a faculty
job, you should know that it's achievable. If you want to be faculty, you
definitely have your work cut out for you, but you should definitely be
getting a PhD.

Not all PhD students want to be faculty. Others know they want to
work on a specific problem that can only be accomplished in academia. This is
also a great reason to get a PhD. In my experience, not many people fit this
description. Plenty of people have some research field they're interested in,
but very few know exactly the problem they want to work on. Keep in mind it
is possible to work on research or in research-adjacent fields without
getting a PhD. For example, many people working on applied cryptography or
cryptography engineering do not have a PhD and are not academics.

For better or for worse, a PhD is also effectively a union card that allows
you to be teaching faculty at a university. If you have no interest in
research but want a full-time non-adjunct teaching position, especially at a
top school[^2], you need a PhD. If you know that a teaching position is your
goal, look for opportunities and advisors where you can do research about
effective teaching. Take opportunities to teach while in grad school,
especially opportunities to lecture rather than be a teaching assistant. If
teaching is a "nice to have," and not your ultimate goal, concentrate on your
other research, but don't necessarily shy away from opportunities to teach.

There's another class of students that are PhD students primarily because
they are good at school, and getting a PhD is the most school you can do.
Often these students have strong transcripts, and so if they know what
to say in their applications, they can fairly easily make their way into PhD
programs. Unfortunately, this is arguably the worst reason to get PhD.
Classes are only a small part of a PhD, and are not as important as
publishing. In fact, you will likely be done with classes before you're even
halfway done with a PhD program. You are in a PhD program to do research.
There is no rubric to meet, no test to study for, and there are no answers in
office hours. It is an experience unique from other types of school, and it
will break you if completing more school is the reward you seek.

A similar but distinct class of PhD students are getting a PhD because
everything else seemed boring. This is an alright reason to start a PhD,
especially if you are going directly from an undergraduate program and have
some general research interests. This is a bad reason to _stay_ in a PhD
program. I put myself largely in this camp, with a little bit of "good at
school, ergo do more school" thrown in. If getting a PhD and doing research
sounds better than the other options, that's a fine reason to get started,
but you're going to need to find some other motivation for sticking through
it if you want to finish. A slightly different variant of this are the people
getting a PhD because they don't want to "be an adult", or because they want
to avoid the "real world". This is also a terrible decision. You're going to
hate your life and want to quit (but you likely won't, out of fear of
failure). You should either find a real reason to stay a grad student, or
leave. If you do finish out of some sense of obligation, you'll likely find
out that whatever it is that you end up doing didn't actually require you to
have a PhD in the first place.

Unlike a PhD, a Master's program is a great place to avoid being an adult for
a year or two, especially with the current explosion in undergraduate
enrollment in computer science. Many undergraduate programs are short on
faculty, staff and teaching assistants. If you can get a free Master's degree
by working as a teaching assistant and you want another year of college to
sort yourself out, _go for it_.

Master's programs aren't just for people looking for another year of beer
pong. If you're shooting for a very specific job straight out of school, and
want another internship or two to work towards that direction, a Master's can
also make sense. The same advice applies if you don't have an undergraduate degree from a
traditionally top school but are able to "level up" for your Master's---this
could help you get noticed by the classic large tech companies since you'll
show up as part of their University recruiting efforts. Keep in mind that getting
a Master's degree for this reason is very expensive, both in terms of
opportunity and direct financial cost. You might be better off with two years
of industry experience under your belt. You'll certainly have more money that
way.[^3]

If you're in a PhD program, but you're not aiming for a faculty position, and
you don't want to teach, make sure you know what the alternatives are. You
don't need a PhD to get an interesting job in industry, for whatever
definition of "interesting" you want. Consider what you are going to do after
you defend---do you need to have defended to have access the opportunities
you want? There's certainly intrinsic value simply in finishing a PhD, but
opportunity cost is also very real, and the process can be [isolating,
demeaning, and disheartening][gradschoolmentalhealth].

I've been in the notorious position in grad school where I hated my life, and
I was wondering why I was there. In the fall of 2015, the start of my second
year, I was lucky to line up an internship at Google on the Chrome Security
team for the following summer. While I was interviewing, I was originally
planning on quitting the PhD program and hoping to get a full-time job at
Google after my internship. By the time I actually started the internship, I
had decided I wanted to stay in grad school. In November of 2015, I read a
paper by Phil Rogaway, ["The Moral Character of Cryptographic
Work"][moralcrypto], which inspired me to keep working on some projects that
I thought were important, but wouldn't necessarily result in publications. I
also sorted out what I actually wanted to do with my career and my life, at
least for the next few years, and thought about what I enjoyed doing outside
of school.

For me, I finished my PhD because I was proud of the work we were doing. I
thought we had a positive impact on the security of the Internet as a whole.
I knew I didn't want to stick with the program long enough to have a CV that
would give me a shot at being faculty. I saw the opportunity to spin out
Censys into a company. I knew I wanted the ability to go back into academia
and the option to go back and teach. So, despite spending the last one and a
half years primarily working on Censys (the work of industry and the salary
of grad school!), it was incredibly important to me to write a dissertation
and defend my PhD.

To sum up:

- Don't go to grad school because you're good at school and it's more school.
- Don't get a PhD because you're avoiding "becoming an adult" or "the real world".
- Don't get a PhD because you think you need one to get a good job.
- Don't _not_ get a PhD because you think it would be impossible to be faculty anyway.
- Definitely _actually enjoy_ the field you're studying.

I certainly don't want to suggest that this is an exhaustive list of reasons
to go to grad school, but I hope it can provide some context for why people
do put themselves through grad school, or provide some help to people
considering applying to graduate programs. This is also very colored by my
experiences in computer science; your mileage will certainly vary in other
fields. Many PhD programs in computer science have a 30-60% completion rate.
Part of this is because of the allure of high-paying jobs in industry, but
part of this is due to people applying to PhD programs for the wrong reasons
and wasting a few years of their life. If you end up in this situation,
you're [probably not going to have a good time][quitting].

Did you go to grad school for different reasons? Did it work out? [Let me

[^1]: This is certainly easier said than done, and is a topic for a different post. You probably shouldn't take my advice on this anyway, since my CV would not get me a faculty job. This advice is also very computer-science specific, and if you're not a white male, you're going to have a [harder time][sexism]. If you're applying to grad schools and considering a faculty career, definitely talk to senior grad students and assistant professors about what hiring is like in your field.
[^2]: Some schools, such as Stanford, have tenure-track teaching faculty positions. Others, such as Michigan, have salaried non-adjunct lecturer positions.
[^4]: This is standard in STEM fields. If you're paying for your own PhD, you are being exploited.
[^3]: What I say about Master's degrees is _very_ computer science specific, and does not apply to other fields.
[^5]: There's always a few surprises each year, and there's certainly a random element to it, but it's not a random draw from a hat full of all PhD students graduating each year.
