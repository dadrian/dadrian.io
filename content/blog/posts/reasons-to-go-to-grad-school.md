Last December, I {{< staticlink "srv/papers/david-adrian-dissertation.pdf"
>}}defended{{< /staticlink >}} my PhD at the University of Michigan. At the
time, I'd been in grad school for four and a half years, and I'd been working
with my research group for another year on top of that. I also went to
Michigan for undergrad, so I've been living in Ann Arbor for nearly nine
years. Why did I do this?

Before I go on, I want to say a few things up front. I went to graduate
school in computer science. I can't speak from personal experience about
other fields, and certainly can't speak for non-STEM fields. I'm also a white
guy from a privileged upper-middle class background, and so everything I say
is colored from that perspective.

Prior to my senior year of undergrad, I cold-emailed [Zakir Durumeric][zakir]
about the possibility of doing research. At the time, Zakir was a second-year
graduate student working with [Alex Halderman][jhalderm]. I'd met Zakir
before, and he was a teaching assistant for the computer security course I
took. Prior to sending the email, I was convinced I wasn't smart enough to
work with Halderman's research group. Luckily, a friend of mine told me to
stop doubting myself and send the email. This was arguably single most
important piece of advice I received in all of undergrad. I would not have
PhD or a [company][censys] if I did not send that email.

Why did I want to go to grad school? It was a combination of reasons, some
good, some bad. I knew I didn't want to spend a career building CRUD apps,
and while you certainly don't need a PhD to work on something else, I was
going to barely be 21 years old when I graduated undergrad. I didn't want to
be an adult (or have any idea what life was like outside of school), and I
thought the [Mining Your Ps and Qs][psqs] paper was awesome. At the time, I
also didn't want to move to the west coast.

The best reason to get a PhD is because you want to be research faculty.
There is no way to have a tenure-track faculty position without a
PhD. Some people will tell you that the market for faculty positions is a
random dice roll, since there are so few positions relative to candidates.
This is not true in computer science, and especially not true in security and
cryptography. Every year, there are a set of top faculty candidates on the
market. Many schools will be interested in the same or overlapping subsets of
candidates. If you're keeping up with the field and familiar with the hiring
process, it's not hard to predict who will be offered tenure-track assistant
professor positions. If the market was random, you would not be able to identify
every year who on the market was going to get job offers. The random part of
the market is figuring out _where_ that job will be (especially among the top
fifteen or so schools), and which school will actually end up sending an
offer to which candidate. Even if you're at the top of the market, don't
expect to be able to get a faculty position in a city that you actually want
to live in. The market is incredibly competitive. Imagine there's 100
candidates. Of these, only five candidates are qualified, and any given
school will think that only three of the candidates out of the five are a
match, and then only manage to send an offer to one or two of them. It is
straightforward to identify who is at the top of the market. It is hard to
actually _be_ at the top of the market.

Not all PhD students come in to the program with a faculty position as the
goal. Others know they want to work on a specific problem that can only be
accomplished in academia. This is also a great reason to get a PhD. In my
experience, not many people fit this description. Plenty of people have some
research field they're interested in, but very few know exactly the problem
they want to work on. Keep in mind it is possible to work on research or in
research-adjacent fields without getting a PhD. For example, many people
working on applied cryptography or cryptography engineering do not have a PhD
and are not academics.

For better or for worse, a PhD is also effectively a union card that allows
you to be teaching faculty at a university. If you have no interest in
research, but want a full-time non-adjunct teaching position, especially at a
top school[^1], you need a PhD. If you know that a teaching position is your
goal, look for opportunities and advisors where you can do research about
effective teaching. Take opportunities to teach while in grad school,
especially opportunities to lecture rather than be a teaching assistant. If
teaching is a "nice to have", and not the ultimate goal, concentrate on your
other research, but don't necessarily shy away from opportunities to teach.

There's another class of students that are PhD students primarily because
they are good at school, and getting a PhD is the most school you can do.
Often times these students have strong transcripts, and so if they know what
to say in their applications, they can fairly easily make their way into PhD
programs. Unfortunately, this is arguably the worst reason to get PhD.
Classes are only a small part of a PhD, and are not as important as
publishing. In fact, you will likely be done with classes before you're even
halfway done with a PhD program. You are in a PhD program to do research.
There is no rubric to meet, no test to study for, and there are no answers in
office hours. It is an experience unique from other types of school, and it
will break you if completing more school is the reward you seek.

A similar, but different class of PhD students are getting a PhD because
everything else seemed boring. This is a alright reason to start a PhD,
especially if you are going directly from an undergraduate program and have
some general research interests but a bad reason to _stay_ in a PhD program.
I put myself largely in this camp, with a little bit of "good at school, ergo
do more school" thrown in. If getting a PhD and doing research sounds better
than the other options, that's a fine reason to get started, but you're going
to need to find some other motivation for sticking through it if you want to
finish.

At the same time, make sure you know what the alternatives are. You don't
need a PhD to get an interesting job in industry, for whatever definition of
"interesting" you want. Consider what you are going to do after you
defend---do you need to have defended to have access the opportunities you
want? There's certainly intrinsic value simply in finishing a PhD, but opportunity cost is also incredibly real, and the process can be isolating, demeaning, and disheartening.

For me, I stuck through it because I was proud of the work we were doing. I
thought we had a positive impact on the security of the Internet as a whole.
I knew I didn't want to stick with the program long enough to have a CV that
would give me a shot at being faculty. I saw the opportunity to spin out
Censys into a company. I knew I wanted the ability to go back into academia,
and the option to go back and teach. So, despite spending the last 1.5 years
primarily working for Censys, it was incredibly important to me to write a
dissertation and defend my PhD.

- Don't go to grad school because you're good at school, and it's more school.
- Don't get a PhD because you're avoiding "becoming an adult" or the "real world".
- Don't get a PhD because you think you need one to get a good job.
- Don't get a PhD because your company is paying for it.

I certainly don't want to suggest that this is an exhaustive list of reasons
to go to grad school, but I hope it can provide some context for why people
do put themselves through grad school, or provide some help to people
considering applying to graduate programs. This is also very colored by my
experiences in computer science, your mileage will certainly vary in other
fields. Many PhD programs in computer science have a 30-60% completion rate.
Part of this is because of the allure of high-paying jobs in industry, but
part of this is due to people applying to PhD programs for the wrong reasons,
and wasting a few years of their life. If you end up in this situation,
you're [probably not going to have a good time][gradschoolmentalhealth].

Did you go to grad school for different reasons? Did it work out? [Let me
