The [Heartbleed vulnerability][heartbleed] is now five years old[^1].

Heartbleed was a remotely-exploitable buffer overrun vulnerability that
exposed the contents of server memory. It allowed attackers to invisibly read
sensitive data from a web server. The bug itself has been written about
[ad][heartbleed-ars] [nauseam][nyt-pre-exploit], including a great explainer
on [XKCD][xkcd-heartbleed]. That's not what this post is about. At the time
Heartbleed was announced, I was just finishing my undergraduate degree at The
University of Michigan, and I was planning on staying at Michigan for
graduate school. I was working on [ZMap][zmap] with another graduate student
[Zakir Durumeric][zakir], and our advisor [Alex Halderman][alex]. Using ZMap,
we become the authoritative source for measurements about the impact of
Heartbleed, which we [posted online][zmap-heartbleed]. This is the story of
how to measure vulnerability to Heartbleed, how I was introduced to a New
York Times reporter as "undergrad", and my first Go program.
