Peter Thiel has a four-quadrant framework for how people think about the future,
described both in his 2013 SXSW talk, [“You are not a lottery
ticket”][sxsw-thiel], as well as in his book, “Zero to One”. Thiel’s commentary
is about society writ large and part of an ideological framework for investing
in startups. Instead, let’s use Thiel’s framework to understand security teams,
including both [teams that secure products and teams that secure
organizations][dadrian-teams].  To do this, we’ll first go through the framework
and the four quadrants themselves, then we’ll map security teams and well-known
security initiatives to the quadrants.
