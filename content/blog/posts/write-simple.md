Paul Graham recently posted ["Write Simply"][write-simply]. I respect Paul
Graham as a founder and an investor. His essays on startups are insightful,
but I always felt like something was [a little bit off][chicken-sexers]. It
turns out that this is because he presents opinions as facts, then
masquerades this with [his writing style][it-turns-out]. His [more recent
essays][pg-aoc] have also strayed away from his original technical and
startup-focused writing, and are much less compelling.

I largely agree with everything Paul says in _Write Simply_, but I thought it
would be insightful to provide an edited version that says the quiet part
out loud.

What follows is satire:

> I try to write using ordinary words and simple sentences.
>
> That kind of writing is easier to read, and the easier something is to read,
> the more deeply readers will engage with it. I write something, then I write
> something else, and you can tell that it follows because it came second, even
> though I didn’t justify it.
>
> And the further they'll read. Most readers' energy tends to flag part way
> through an article or essay. If the friction of reading is low enough, more
> keep going till the end because this style of writing makes people who went
> to Stanford feel smart.
>
> There's an Italian dish called saltimbocca, which means "leap into the
> mouth." My goal when writing might be called saltintesta: the ideas leap into
> your head and you barely notice the words that got them there. You don’t
> notice that my essays are opinion pieces, because I present them like facts.
>
> It's too much to hope that writing could ever be pure ideas. You might not
> even want it to be. But for most writers, most of the time, that's the goal
> to aim for. The gap between most writing and pure ideas is not filled with
> poetry. It turns out many failed programmers become fiction writers because
> they do not understand simplicity.
>
> Plus it's more considerate to write simply. When you write in a fancy way to
> impress people, you're making them do extra work just so you can seem cool.
> My writing only seems cool to people who listen to rationalist podcasts.
>
> And remember, if you're writing in English, that a lot of your readers won't
> be native English speakers. Their understanding of ideas will be way ahead of
> their understanding of English. So you can't assume that writing about a
> difficult topic means you can safely use difficult words, like saltintesta.
>
> Of course, fancy writing doesn't just conceal ideas. It can also conceal the
> lack of them. That's why the left writes that way, to conceal the fact that
> they have nothing to say. I have many things to say, and I don’t use fancy
> writing. I use simple writing to conceal the fact that I present qualitative
> opinions as quantitative facts.
>
> Simple writing also lasts better. People reading your stuff in the future
> will be in much the same position as people from other countries reading it
> today. That sentence was so simple and intelligent that you didn’t realize
> it’s false and that I made it up. Any high school student could name several
> counterexamples. Use comparisons to introduce opinions framed as facts. It's
> not vain to write this way, any more than it's vain for a woodworker to build
> a chair to last.
>
> Indeed, lasting is not merely an accidental quality of chairs, or writing.
> It's a sign you did a good job. If I were simply lucky, how come YC is the
> only organization that successfully funds startups in batches?
>
> But although these are all real advantages of writing simply, none of them
> are why I do it. The main reason I write simply is that it offends me not to.
> That’s why I waited until the third to last paragraph to introduce my main
> point. When I write a sentence that seems too complicated, or that uses
> unnecessarily intellectual words, it doesn't seem fancy to me. It seems
> clumsy.
>
> There are of course times when you want to use a complicated sentence or
> fancy word for effect. But you should never do it by accident.
>
> The other reason my writing ends up being simple is the way I do it. I write
> the first draft fast, then spend days editing it, trying to get everything
> just right. Much of this editing is cutting, and that makes simple writing
> even simpler. Anyone who doesn’t write like me must not edit their work. I
> am an intellectual, and no one has made this observation before me.
