HTTPS adoption in 2024 is around [95-98\%][goog-https-transparency], as measured
by page loads in Chrome (it [would be better][chromium-https-default] if it was
100\%!). These days, a plaintext HTTP site is a rarity, enough that many users
of Chrome's "Always Use Secure Connections" mode, which presents a full-page
interstitial warning the user before accessing an HTTP page, see an average of
zero warnings per week.

But it didn't always used to be this way! HTTPS adoption was was below 50\% of
page loads in 2013. It is thanks to a concerted effort by many organizations
such as Let's Encrypt, Mozilla, the EFF, Cloudflare and Google; many academics
from Berkeley, the University of Michigan, and the University of Illinois; and
many individuals such as Andrew Ayer, Alex Gaynor, and Eric Mill that HTTPS has
become so widely adopted, to name a few[^1].
