The market is a “downturn” (cough recession cough), and this is percolating into
the venture-backed startup ecosystem. The broad consensus is that the top end of
startup valuations are coming back to reality. But what does this mean? What
makes a valuation out of this world? And how does this affect employees?

The general rule of thumb for valuations of startup software companies is that
the valuation is 10x the annual revenue, with 20x for companies with incredibly
strong growth potential. This starts to have meaning usually around Series A.
Very early companies raising seed and pre-seed rounds likely have zero or
next-to-zero revenue, and will usually be given a valuation in the $5-20M range
based on how good of a team and a story the founders can put together, and
whether or not the founders are white men.

Once a startup reaches a point where they’re actually selling a product and
making some revenue, they will eventually need to get to an annual revenue
number that is 10% of their valuation. The better the growth potential and the
better of a storyteller the CEO is, the longer they can put this off. Startup
valuations are determined by the amount of money a company raises in exchange
for a percentage of ownership. Usually, this is a 20% stake, meaning that a
company that raises a $15M Series A is usually valued at $15M / 0.2 = $75M. This
means the company needs $75M / 10 = $7.5M in annual revenue to maintain that
valuation.

If you are offered options or stock as part of a compensation package at a
startup, the strike price and value of those options are based on the valuation
of the company at the time that you join. Some people who took jobs with
startups that offered stock worth a lot of money “on-paper” are realizing that
the company is not able to reach the amount of growth required to sustain its
valuation. These companies will have to raise a down round or drastically cut
costs in order to have enough runway to stay alive long enough to get revenue to
a sustainable level, unless they can somehow find a greater fool to sell to at
an even higher valuation. This may result in the stock becoming worth a lot less
than it initially appeared.

The loftier the goals of the startup and the better the economy, the longer an
unrealistic disconnect between valuation and revenue can be maintained. Founders
will raise at high valuations because they likely can take some money off the
table during the high valuation rounds, and it dilutes less. It makes a company
appear as though it is successful, and draws attention of customers and future
investors. They may have aspirations for the company that match a higher
valuation. And venture capitalists generally would rather see you try to get to
$10B exit and fail, than “sell out” for less than $1B.

With a large enough reality distortion field, some startups might even manage to
IPO at multiples considerably above 10x revenue. This can be especially good for
early investors and employees, since after the lock-out period, they can all
dump their shares on the retail stock market. This is fairly rare, and likely
still requires $100M-$1B in annual revenue. Even in cases with sane multiples,
it’s not necessarily wrong to think of venture capital as a dump on
retail---someone is paying out the valuation back to the investors.

Given some public information about raises, and ideally, a share price or strike
price, you should be able to figure out valuations and how much you would make
on potential exits. You can plug in the values you know, either from press
releases or an offer letter, and backcalculate how much your offer is worth, and
if the company is at a sustainable valuation. If the company is not at a
sustainable valuation, try to figure out if there’s a path for the sales numbers
to make sense, or if the CEO is capable of maintaining reality distortion field.
If not, know that the money is going to dry up. This might be OK, depending on
your career, and your cash salary, and your value to the company, or it might
make your offer much worse than it appears on paper.

Rules of Thumb:
* Dilution is usually 20-30% for earlier rounds, and 10-20% for later rounds (Series D+)
* Valuation is capital raised divided by the dilution
* Strike price is a 60% discount on the share price, assuming there’s not an active secondary market for the stock
* The share price is the valuation divided by the number of shares
* Your ownership is the number of shares in your grant divided by the total number of shares
* There is usually 8-12M shares issued when a company is founded, of which 15-30% will be allocated for employees
* Each round, new shares are issued to the investors participating in the round, in proportion to the dilution.
* At acquisition, money is (usually) paid out in proportion to percentage ownership, with the investors getting paid out their principle first.
* Once you have stock, you will be diluted on future rounds
* Your ownership percentage will decrease by the dilution, but ideally the total value of your ownership will increase because the valuation is also increasing.
* Your new ownership percentage is the old percentage scaled by 1 minus the dilution.
* Your new ownership “value” is the new percentage multiplied by the new valuation.

This might seem complicated, but it's nothing harder than a high school algebra
homework problem.
