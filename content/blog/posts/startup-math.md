The market is a “downturn” (cough recession cough), and this is percolating into the venture-backed startup ecosystem. The broad consensus is that the top end of startup valuations are coming back to reality. But what does this mean? What makes a valuation out of this world? And how does this affect employees?

The general rule of thumb for valuations of software companies is that the valuation is 10x the annual revenue, with 20x for companies with incredibly strong growth potential. This starts to have meaning usually around Series A. Very early companies raising seed and pre-seed rounds likely have zero or next-to-zero revenue, and will be given a valuation in the $5-20M range based on how good of a team and a story the founders can put together, and whether or not the founders are white men.

Once a startup reaches a point where they’re actually selling a product and making some revenue, they will eventually need to get to an annual number that is 10% of their valuation. Startup valuations are determined by the amount of money a company raises in exchange for a percentage of ownership. Usually, this is a 20% stake, meaning that a company that raises a $15M Series A is usually valued at $15M / 0.2 = $75M. This means the company should have $75M / 10 = $7.5M in annual revenue to maintain that valuation.

Rules of Thumb:
Dilution is usually 20-30% for earlier rounds, and 10-20% for later rounds (Series D+)
Valuation is capital raised divided by the dilution
Strike price is a 60% discount on the share price
The share price is the valuation divided by the number of shares
Your ownership is the number of shares in your grant divided by the total number of shares
There is usually 8-12M shares issued when a company is founded, of which 15-30% will be allocated for employees
Each round, new shares are issued to the investors participating in the round, in proportion to the dilution

Given all of this, you can plug in the values you know, either from press releases or an offer letter, and backcalculate how much your offer is worth, and if the company is at a sustainable valuation.

Some people who took jobs with startups that offered stock options or RSUs that “on-paper” were worth a lot of money are suddenly realizing that the company is not able to reach the amount of growth required to sustain its valuation, and that it will have to raise a down round or drastically cut costs in order to have enough runway to stay alive long enough to get revenue to a sustainable level.
