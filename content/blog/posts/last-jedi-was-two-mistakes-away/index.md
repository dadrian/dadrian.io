It's been over a year since _The Last Jedi_ was released in theaters. It's
been part of the Netflix lineup for six months. We've all moved past it.
Which is why I'm here to say that we shouldn't move past it. The Last Jedi is
not a bad movie, and is only two mistakes away from being the best Star Wars
movie created. Unfortunately, these mistakes do take away from The Last
Jedi---it's certainly no _Empire_, but it is on par with original trilogy and
certainly better than the prequels. I'm explicitly _not_ comparing it to
_Rogue One_ or _Solo_. Also, this post obviously has spoilers. The movie is
over a year old folks, go watch it.

## Good Things

Before I talk about the mistakes, I want to talk about some good parts of The
Last Jedi that do stand out.

### Rey and Kylo Fight Scene

There's not much to say about this scene. It's really cool, and it's a lot
better than watching Ewan McGregor fight some battle droids. Snoke was an
underdeveloped character, so he either needed to be developed more or written
out. I'm fine with writing him out and getting to watch this instead. Do you
really want to watch Rey fight Snoke in Episode IX just like Luke fought
Palpatine?

Rey and Kylo kill some space fascists. Everybody loves this scene.

### Cinematography on Crait

After the Resistance ships are destroyed by the First Order, the survivors
sneak away to a nearby abandoned Rebel base on the planet Crait. This
culminates in a lightsaber battle between Kylo Ren and a Force projection of
Luke Skywalker. From a writing standpoint, the projections are a clever new
mechanic that fit in nicely with the previous trope of dead Jedi appearing as
fuzzy holograms. The dialogue between Luke and Kylo also very clearly shows
the central theme of the movie, and avoids a repeat of previous Light Side vs
Dark Side battles.

> _Kylo_: Did you come back to say you forgive me? To save my soul? <br />
> _Luke_: No.

Aside from Rose crashing her speeder into Finn to prevent his suicide run, I
haven't seen much criticism of this part of the movie. I'll talk about Rose
and Finn later, but for now, here's a couple of my favorite camera shots from Crait.

The end of _The Force Awakens_ was full of shots of blue and red lightsabers
against a snowy, white background. While we did get a little bit of that in _The Last
Jedi_ from the salt, instead the lightsaber battle on Crait was framed by a sunset.

### The Return of Puppet Yoda

The character Yoda, while originally created and written by George Lucas, was
conceived and brought to life by Frank Oz of The Muppets. Just like Kermit
the Frog, Yoda was created as a puppet, and all the scenes in the original
trilogy were filmed with Frank Oz voicing and puppeteering Yoda. In the
prequels, Yoda was entirely CGI and also not good, so I was excited to see
the puppet again. Oddly, Puppet Yoda is much more expressive than rendered
Yoda, but that may be a symptom of 2002-era CGI as compared to 2018.

{{% imgproc yoda-luke-background Resize "1080x" %}}
Puppet Yoda is definitely superior to the CGI Yoda from the prequels.

More important than Yoda being a puppet, was what Yoda actually had to say in
The Last Jedi. Other people have [written about this extensively][yoda], but
Yoda has never actually given good advice or acted as an effective leader.
Throughout the past movies he's incorrectly allowed Anakin to be trained,
sent dozens of Jedi to their deaths on Geonosis despite having a Clone Army
minutes away, failed to discover Palpatine was Sith or defeat him in combat,
ran away and hid on Dagobah instead of dealing with the problems he created,
and failed to give Luke the proper training to protect him from Vader on
Cloud City. This all changed in The Last Jedi.

> We are what they grow beyond.

This is the first movie in which Yoda gives good advice. And not only is good
advice, it's fucking great advice. He smacks Luke in the forehead and tells
him to get over himself. Don't do what Yoda did and wallow in your failure.
It's alright that Luke doesn't know how to handle Kylo Ren. That doesn't mean
he can't help Rey. Luke needs to pass on not just his knowledge of the Jedi,
but pass on his own failures. He needs to let Rey make her own mistakes, but
with enough support that they won't be fatal. He doesn't need to train Rey to
be Luke, he needs to train Rey so she can grow herself. Yoda convinces Luke
to stop wallowing in his own self-hatred, and fully give himself to the
people he loves, and the causes he cares about. This is probably my favorite
scene in the movie, and not just because it reminds me of grad school.

### Let the Past Die

Last Jedi hits you in the face with the theme of the movie, to the point of having Kylo Ren spell it out to Rey.

> Let the past die.

Each of the main characters goes through their own personal struggle with the
past. Kylo Ren is striving to live up to Vader's legacy and gain approval
from Snoke. As a result, he's haunted by the presence of Luke Skywalker, who
is a living testament to his grandfather's failures.

Rey desperately wants to know who her parents are.

## Being Great

This is the first time in three decades that we don't know what is going to
happen in the next Star Wars movie.
