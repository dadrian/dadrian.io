It's been over a year since _The Last Jedi_ was released in theaters. It's
been part of the Netflix lineup for six months. We've all moved past it.
Which is why I'm here to say that we shouldn't move past it. The Last Jedi is
not a bad movie, and is only two mistakes away from being the best Star Wars
movie created. Unfortunately, these mistakes do take away from The Last
Jedi---it's certainly no _Empire_, but it is on par with original trilogy and
certainly better than the prequels. I'm explicitly _not_ comparing it to
_Rogue One_ or _Solo_. Also, this post obviously has spoilers. The movie is
over a year old folks, go watch it.

## Good Things

Before I talk about the mistakes, I want to talk about some good parts of The
Last Jedi that do stand out.

### Let the past die

### Cinematography on Crait

After the Resistance ships are destroyed by the First Order, the survivors
sneak away to a nearby abandoned Rebel base on the planet Crait. This
culminates in a lightsaber battle between Kylo Ren and a Force projection of
Luke Skywalker. From a writing standpoint, the projections are a clever new
mechanic that fit in nicely with the previous trope of dead Jedi appearing as
fuzzy holograms. The dialogue between Luke and Kylo also very clearly shows
the central theme of the movie, and avoids a repeat of previous Light Side vs
Dark Side battles.

> _Kylo_: Did you come back to say you forgive me? To save my soul? <br />
> _Luke_: No.

Aside from Rose crashing her speeder into Finn to prevent his suicide run, I
haven't seen much criticism of this part of the movie. I'll talk about Rose
and Finn later, but for now, here's a couple of my favorite camera shots from Crait.

Crait. Best enjoyed with a John Williams soundtrack.

The end of _The Force Awakens_ was full of shots of blue and red lightsabers
against a snowy, white background. While we did get a little bit of that in _The Last
Jedi_ from the salt, instead the lightsaber battle on Crait was framed by a sunset.

This is the first time in three decades that we don't know what is going to
happen in the next Star Wars movie.
