_This is a follow-on to my post ["Reasons to go to grad
school"](/reasons-to-go-to-grad-school) from seven years ago._

So you're finishing your PhD or postdoc in a computer-related field, and you're
trying to make the decision about faculty (or some other form of continuing
academia) versus industry.

First off, congratulations. You did it! (Or are about to).

Eight years ago, I implicitly made the decision to not become faculty when I
instead decided to try to make [Censys][censys] a real thing by spinning out a
startup. That's a story for another time[^1], but it does mean I can more
directly represent the industry side. I've kept one foot in academia pretty much
the whole time since I left, and many of my closest friends are faculty. In the
past two years, I've talked with quite a few people who have had to make similar
decisions, either at the end of their PhD, their postdoc, or even after
receiving tenure.

The first two things you should understand are actually two sides of the same coin:

1. Getting a PhD and not going into academia does not make you a failure or mean
   that you made the wrong decision to get a PhD[^2].
2. Not going for faculty because you're worried you might not get what you want
   or be good at it is a bad reason to go to industry.

Both of these are variants on the theme of you should do the thing that sparks
joy, even if it's scary. When I was a child, my mother would often tell me
"sometimes, you have to be brave and try new things".

However, at this time, I knew I
didn't have the research pedigree to get a faculty job at a [top 15][top-15], or even
top 50 school. So I thought I'd make a career out







[^1]: Specifically, sometime after Censys exits. It's still alive and growing!
[^2]: If you went into debt instead of having a funded PhD, and then go do something that didn't require a PhD in the first place, then you probably made the wrong decision. But I'm assuming a funded STEM PhD in computers.
