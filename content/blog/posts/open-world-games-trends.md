title: "Is open-world making games worse, or am I just getting old?"

Around the time that Elden Ring came out (an actually good open-world game), I
had the thought that it seemed like AAA games were getting worse, especially
post-pandemic. It also seemed like there were more and more open-world games and
more games in large franchises (rather than new IP). My hypothesis was that open-world was increasing because it's
easier to scale-up an open-world game to match the expectations on today's
games---give each designer a separate region, cut dependencies between various
levels and teams.

It's easier to pitch "We'll build this giant world, it'll be dope" than it
is to say "Trust us, we're gonna design 10 incredible levels". However, just
because something is open-world and big, doesn't mean that it will be fun. The
risk with open-world is that you exchange scale for cohesion and quality. The
main driver for progressing in a game stops being winning or going on a journey
with the characters, and becomes completing a map and making stats go up. The
games become less fun and more repetitive.

It's also less risky to pitch a game in an existing, successful franchise, than
it is to make something new. So as [costs of AAA games are going up][aaa-cost],
I expected there to be more franchise games.

The idea that there were more open-world games and more franchise games, and
that these games were getting worse, seemed aligned with my lived experience. I
could go on and list some examples of games. But, most of this hypothesizing is
just me [making stuff up!][david-tweet-thread]. Instead, let's look at the data
and determine if the premises for this hypothesis are even true, or if it's
based on faulty assumptions. Let's be specific, so here's the hypothesis:

> AAA games are getting worse, because as they scale up for new console
> generations, more and more AAA games are open-world or in existing franchises,
> and both of these trends tend to result in worse games.

Ignoring whether or not open-world games and franchise games are worse than other
games, this hypothesis is based on a premise that is testable with some basic
data analysis---**are there more open-world and more large franchise AAA games
now, than there were in the 2000s?**.

## Methodology

The [Internet Game Database][igdb] (IGDB) has a dataset consisting of just about
every game and its release date(s), platforms, publisher, developer, and
[MetaCritic][metacritic] score. The population for the data analysis will be
_any game released on a [Generation V][gen5] or newer non-smartphone console
platform in IGDB.

Another paragraph. Such writing. Wow.
