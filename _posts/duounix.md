Over the summer, I interned at [Duo Security](https://duosecurity.com). One of
the projects I worked on was the [Duo Unix
integration](https://www.duosecurity.com/docs/duounix). Mark Stanislav, Duo's
security evangelist, wrote a quick writeup on some of the features I added
[here](https://blog.duosecurity.com/2013/10/duo-unix-three-new-features-youll-
love/).
