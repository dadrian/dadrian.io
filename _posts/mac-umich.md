OS X Mavericks changed what developer utilites are installed and available on
a Mac, and how to install new ones. Apple likes to think the only way people
ever would want to compile anything is by hitting a big "Play!" button in
Xcode, but in reality there are plenty of times where you either have to or
want to compile on the command-line in a terminal. This post describe how to
get a working install of `gcc`, `g++`, and `gdb` on OS X Mavericks.

1. [Install Xcode](#xcode)
2. [Install Xcode Developer Toosl](#dev-tools)
3. [Install brew](#brew)
4. [Install Compilers and Debuggers](#gcc)
